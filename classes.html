    <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
    <p>Prepare yourself for Savasana. Lie down on your yoga
        mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close
        your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the
        mat and let your worries slip away. When you are
        ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push
        yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place
        your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that
        you have in life. Namaste.</p>
